# ubuntu_basic_software
My basic Ubuntu software installation script after fresh OS install (tested on ubuntu 16.04).

To run software installation you need to give privileges to apps.sh script (sudo chmod 755 apps.sh).
Other software that don't have automated installation are in custom_install_apps file.
